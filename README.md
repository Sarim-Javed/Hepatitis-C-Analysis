# Hepatitis-C-Analysis
An analysis of hepatitis C data using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for clustering. This repository contains code for preprocessing the data, fitting a GMM model, and saving the trained model for future use.
Title: Hepatitis C Data Analysis with Gaussian Mixture Models

# Description:
This repository hosts code for an in-depth analysis of hepatitis C data utilizing Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for clustering. Hepatitis C is a significant public health concern worldwide, and understanding its patterns and underlying characteristics is crucial for effective management and treatment strategies.

# Key Features:
**Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding, and standardize the data for model training.
**Model Training:** Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are employed to identify latent clusters within the hepatitis C dataset. The optimal number of clusters is determined using various evaluation metrics.
**Model Evaluation:** The trained GMM model is evaluated using metrics such as silhouette score and log-likelihood to assess its performance and robustness.
**Model Deployment:** The trained GMM model is saved for future use, allowing seamless integration into production environments or further analysis.
# Usage:

# Data Preparation: Ensure the hepatitis C dataset is available in CSV format and located in the specified directory.
**Code Execution:** Execute the provided Python script, which includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and model saving steps.
**Model Interpretation:** Analyze the clustering results obtained from the GMM model to gain insights into distinct subgroups within the hepatitis C population.
